## 前情提要

“具身智能的切入点是灵活手”

为了明确未来的研究方向，需要对具身智能有一定了解。毕竟现在看来cv的未来还是与robotics结合的。

具身智能和自动驾驶差不多，最传统的思路还是模仿学习和强化学习。作为非ai专业学生，还是要补一补这方面的知识。

有两个比较好的学习资料，放在这里，以后要找时间啃下来：

LAMDA的模仿学习教程：[Imitation_Learning.pdf (nju.edu.cn)](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/xut/Imitation_Learning.pdf)

上交“强化学习”课程课本《动手学强化学习》：[前言 (boyuai.com)](https://hrl.boyuai.com/chapter/intro)

为了知道大家都在干啥，还是第一时间读一些论文。

## Definition from CMU

***Robots that perceive, act and collaborate.***

Embodied AI is the integration of machine learning, computer vision, robot learning and language technologies, culminating in the “embodiment” of artificial intelligence: robots that can perceive, act and collaborate.

Robotics, Embodied AI and Learning (REAL) hosts a team of researchers and scientists who are elevating the role of robots from tools to partners, working side by side with humans to solve complex real-world challenges.

## Description from ACM

These foundational studies highlight **three principles** for developing EAI (Embodied Artificial Intelligence) systems. First, EAI systems must not rely on predefined, complex logic to manage specific scenarios. Second, it is essential that EAI systems incorporate evolutionary learning mechanisms, enabling them to adapt continuously to their operational environments. Lastly, the environment plays a pivotal role in shaping not just physical behaviors, but also cognitive structures.

## LLM + Robotics

肯定会存在的一个方向，被吹成“最接近通用人工智能的”LLM，肯定是一个可行的技术路线，但是上限我觉得不好说。
